# Prototype

//-- Greetings --//
Hello future me. I hope you got the dreams I always wanted.

If you are not future me, I do not know why you are here but Hello! I am ZeroTKA and my purpose on this Earth is to create.

This is going to be a long list of things I create and share. I hope you enjoy something I've done but it's also highly sus you are here. 

//-- What this is about --//
This is a prototype I'm creating for the last little bit of my Unity course. After this I will have finished the creative badge or whatever. Wish me luck as I battle to finish it and keep it simple.

Good luck me.
